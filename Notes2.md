# 📘 Chapter 2: Django Foundations – From Project Setup to Views & URLs

---

## 🔶 1. **Introduction to Django**

### 🔸 What is Django?
- **Django** is a high-level Python web framework that enables **rapid development** and promotes **clean, pragmatic design**.
- Developed by experienced developers to help:
  - Build secure and scalable web apps quickly.
  - Avoid "reinventing the wheel" via reusable components.

### 🔸 Why Choose Django?
| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) | Interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL |
| Admin Panel | Auto-generated interface to manage app data |
| Scalability | Used by Instagram, Disqus, Pinterest |
| Security | Prevents CSRF, SQL injection, XSS out of the box |
| MVT Architecture | Encourages separation of logic (Model-View-Template) |

> 💡 **Pro Insight:** Django is perfect for MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and enterprise-grade apps alike.

---

## 🔶 2. **Setting Up a Django Project**

### 📦 Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Install Django (latest version is 5.x as of 2024):
```bash
pip install django
```

---

### 🏗 Create a New Django Project
```bash
django-admin startproject ecommerce
cd ecommerce
```

This creates:
```
ecommerce/
├── manage.py
└── ecommerce/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    ├── asgi.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

### 🏢 Create a Django App
Inside the project directory:
```bash
python manage.py startapp store
```

You now have:
```
store/
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── models.py
├── tests.py
├── views.py
└── migrations/
```

> 🔥 **Expert Tip:** Think of a project like a **company**, and apps like **departments** (HR, Sales). Each app serves a specific purpose.

---

## 🔶 3. **Understanding Django’s Project Structure**

### 🧠 Key Files and Directories

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `manage.py` | CLI tool to manage the project (runserver, migrate, etc.) |
| `settings.py` | Configuration: database, installed apps, middleware |
| `urls.py` | Project-level URL routing |
| `wsgi.py` / `asgi.py` | Deployment interfaces for WSGI/ASGI servers |

### 📁 Virtual Environment (venv)
- Isolates dependencies per project.
```bash
# Create venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate venv (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate venv (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Django inside venv
pip install django
```

> 💡 **Best Practice:** Add `venv/` to `.gitignore` to avoid pushing local environment files to GitHub.

---

## 🔶 4. **Working with Apps, Views, and URLs**

### 🧱 What is a Django App?
- A **self-contained module** that provides one piece of your web app’s functionality.
- Examples:
  - `users` → Login, signup
  - `products` → Add, update products
  - `orders` → Checkout, invoices

Register your app in `settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'store',
    ...
]
```

---

### 🧩 Views – The Brains
- Views handle logic and return responses.
```python
# store/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

---

### 🌐 URLs – Routing System

#### 🔹 Project-level `urls.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('store.urls')),
]
```

#### 🔹 App-level `urls.py` (inside `store/`):
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```

> 🧠 **Expert Insight:** Use `name='hello_world'` for **reverse URL resolution** inside templates or redirects.

---

### 🚀 Start the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- Default: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Custom port: `python manage.py runserver 5000`

> ✅ This is your local dev environment. Not for production!

---

## 🔶 5. **Admin Panel, Models & ORM (High-level Overview)**

### 🛠 Django Admin
- Run:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
- Login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
- Register models to show in the admin panel.

### 🧮 Defining a Model
```python
# store/models.py
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=7, decimal_places=2)
    is_available = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### 🔁 Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## ✅ Summary Checklist

| Task | Done |
|------|------|
| Django installed & virtual env set up | ✅ |
| Project and app created | ✅ |
| Basic view and URL configured | ✅ |
| Server run and tested on browser | ✅ |
| Admin user created and login tested | ✅ |

---

## 🚀 Expert Recommendations

| Pro Tip | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Use `include()` in `urls.py` | Keeps code modular and scalable |
| Keep apps reusable | Future-proof your code for real projects |
| Document endpoints | Use tools like Swagger / Postman later |
| Use class-based views (CBVs) | Cleaner logic for CRUD later on |
| Create `README.md` | Describe app purpose and run steps early |
